                <h1>Frequently Asked Question(FAQs)</h1>
                <hr>
              <p class="question">What is Foodscribe?</p>
              <p>Foodscribe is a food delivery app that makes getting great food from your favorite local restaurants as easy as requesting a ride.</p>
              <p class="question">When is Foodscribe available?</p>
              <p>Foodscribe is available seven days a week, whenever restaurants near you are open and accepting orders.</p>
              <p class="question">Where is Foodscribe available?</p>
              <p>Foodscribe is available throughout Dallas, Fort Worth, Arlington, Irving, Plano, Grapevine, Richardson, Frisco, Garland and Addison. Pop open the app to see the restaurants in your area.</p>
              <p class="question">How do I start using Foodscribe?</p>
              <p><ul>
                <li>1. Search with your delivery address.</li>
                <li>2. Choose from the full menu of best restaurants.</li>
                <li>3. Place your order and follow along as your meal is prepared and delivered by your favorite restaurants!</li>
              </ul>
              </p>
              <p class="question">How much does Foodscribe cost?</p>
              <p>Restaurants offer different meals at varying prices on the Foodscribe website.</br>The booking fee for Foodscribe varies based on several factors, but you'll always see the fee upfront so you know what you're paying before you order.</p>
              <p class="question">What is the booking fee on Foodscribe?</p>
              <p>The booking fee on Foodscribe is a charge you pay for each delivery.</p>
              <p class="question">How do you select restaurants?</p>
              <p>We’ve partnered with top restaurants in Texas to bring their menus to Foodscribe.</p>
              <p class="question">Do I need to tip my delivery partner?</p>
              <p>You have the opportunity to tip your delivery partner in the Foodscribe after your meal is delivered; tipping is optional.</p>
              <p class="question">Will my delivery partner bring the meal to my door or inside my office?</p>
              <p>Your delivery partner will generally bring your order right to your door. If it's easiest for you to walk outside–that's fine too. You can always meet the delivery partner at the curb.</p>
              <p class="question">Why am I paying a fee for busy areas?</p>
              <p>The extra fee ensures reliability. Sometimes there are more orders in a certain area than delivery partners who are able to deliver them. The fee ensures that even when Foodscribe is busy in certain areas, you can still get the food you want when you want it.</p>
              <p class="question">Is the fee for busy areas different from the booking fee?</p>
              <p>Yes. Booking fees are the standard fees that you pay for having your order delivered. The busy area fee will only appear if delivery partners are busy in that restaurant’s particular area.</p>
              <p class="question">How is the fee for busy areas calculated?</p>
              <p>Pricing is dynamic and is calculated by taking into account how many people want to use the service and how many delivery partners are on the road in a certain area.</p>

              <p class="question">Does the busy area fee mean that every restaurant in the city will have an additional fee?</p>
              <p>No, not at all. The extra fee will only appear when Foodscribe is busy in certain areas, and will go away when the amount of orders balances with the number of delivery partners.</p>
              <p class="question">How long will this fee last?</p>
              <p>Fees for busy areas are dynamic so they may come and go depending on the availability of delivery partners in a specific area and demand for restaurants on Foodscribe in that same area.</p>
